## 🧠 KPI Evaluation Logic

Each KPI is evaluated based on thresholds:

| Status  | Condition                                | Color  |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| Poor    | `Actual Value ≤ LT`                      | 🔴 Red  |
| Average | `LT < Actual Value < HT`                 | 🟡 Amber|
| Good    | `Actual Value ≥ HT`                      | 🟢 Green|
